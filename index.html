# Modern Cloud Defense: Addressing Misconfigurations in Hybrid Cloud Environments

In the age of hybrid and multi-cloud environments, visibility and control over misconfigurations is critical. Budgets, time, and resources rarely scale as fast as infrastructure. This hands-on lab walks you through the realities of defending modern cloud environments, using real misconfigurations.

Participants will automate scans against multiple misconfigured environments and learn to interpret findings in context using a set of open-source CSPM tools across simulated multi-cloud infrastructure.

The lab culminates in comparing tools using a **Pugh Matrix**. Attendees will compare tools based on **coverage, usability, integration**, and **accuracy**, equipping them with a repeatable evaluation framework tailored to organizational maturity, size, and resource constraints.
